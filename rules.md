## How to Play Sjuan

The player who has the 7 of hearts starts by playing this card. It is now the next player's turn who either places a 6 or 8 of the same suit, or another 7.

Cards are placed like this: The four 7's are placed next to each other. On one side of the 7's, the 8's are placed, on these the 9's and so on up to the Kings. On the other side, the 6's are placed, on these the 5's and so on down to the Aces. The suit must always be followed. Each player in turn gets to lay a card. If a player cannot place a card, the previous player passes a card of their choice to this player. If you play either an Ace or a King, you may place another card if you wish.

## Who Wins the Game?

The player who first gets rid of their cards wins. If all the cards the player has in their hand can be played, they are laid out and the player wins.
